        <h3 class="question">What does UTF-8 mean?</h3>
        <h5 class="answer">
          UTF-8 is a compromise character encoding that can be as compact as
          ASCII (if the file is just plain English text) but can also contain
          any unicode characters (with some increase in file size). UTF stands
          for Unicode Transformation Format. The '8' means it uses 8-bit blocks
          to represent a character.
